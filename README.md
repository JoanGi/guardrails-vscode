# GuardRails for VSCode 

GuardRails for VSCode is a language plugin to help developers during the creation of the RAILS specification <br>

The project is in early stage, and **is not ready for development**. Please, **help us** to improve the developer exeprience using GuardRails.


If you are seeking for the **GuardRails project** this is the [repo](https://github.com/ShreyaR/guardrails) <br>

## Installation 

Until have a minimal usable version the best way to test the plugin is cloning the repository in local.

Open it with an VSCode instance, and in the debug tag run the "Run Extension" debugging.

This will open a new instance of VSCode with the plugin enabled.



## Contributing

This project is an open-soure project and we are open (and expecting!) to contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing to this project, please first read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines file.

### Repository structure

The following tree shows the list of the repository's relevant sections:

- The *test_lab* folder contains the examples of the RAILs specification. Can be useful to test the plugin.
- The *out* folder contains the executable plugin in JS. You may not want to dive in as it is generated by the TypeScrpit compiler
- The *src* folder contains the project's source code
  - The *cli* folder is the generated grammar and AST from Langium. You may not want to dive in it as it is a generated asset
  - The *generator-service* folder contains all the code of the generation service. Could be a good place to start if you want to improve the generation of the tool.
  - The *language-server* folder contains all the language features, and the grammar declaration. If you want to improve the grammar, or some of the features the plugin offers here is the place you may want to start
    - The *rails.langium* file contains the main grammar declaration. This grammar is developed using the [Langium Grammar Language](https://langium.org/docs/grammar-language/). Please refer to the linked documentation to more insights on how to develop the grammar.
